# [DEPRECATED] Instruction Set Design for RISC-V
This project is no longer actively maintained. While there is no current plan to update or fix bugs, it may be revisited in the future.

## üìù Project Overview  
This project designs a **custom Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** for a RISC-V CPU, developed as part of IT208 Computer Organisation at International Burch University. The implementation incorporates essential components including:

- Program Counter (PC)  
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)  
- Register File  
- Control Unit  
- Memory Units

The custom ISA includes a range of operations‚Äî**arithmetic, logical, load/store, and branch instructions**‚Äîwith detailed documentation on the design, control signals, data flow, and a sample program to demonstrate functionality. 

## üìö Acknowledgments  
This work was developed with guidance from course materials provided by TA Benjamin Peljto and the Department of Information Technologies at International Burch University. The project builds upon foundational RISC-V concepts covered in the course.

## üìú Supported Instructions  

### **Arithmetic Instructions (R-type)**  
| Instruction | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `add`  | Adds the values of two registers and stores the result in a third register. |
| `sub`  | Subtracts the value of one register from another and stores the result in a third register. |

### **Logical Instructions (R-type)**  
| Instruction | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `and`  | Performs a bit-wise AND between two registers. |

### **Branch Instructions (B-type)**  
| Instruction | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `beq`  | Branches to a specified address if two registers are equal. |
| `blt`  | Branches to a specified address if the first register is less than the second. |
> blt instruction has been implemented incorrectly, there is a possibility that it might be fixed in the future, but for the time being, this repository is deprecated

### **Load/Store Instructions (I-type, S-type)**  
| Instruction | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `lw`   | Loads a word from memory into a register. |
| `sw`   | Stores a word from a register into memory. |
| `addi` | Adds an immediate value to a register's value and stores the result in the specified register. |

## üñ•Ô∏è Instruction Format  
All instructions follow **RISC-V standard formats** (R-type, I-type, S-type, B-type), utilizing:  
- **Opcode**  
- **Funct3**  
- **Funct7**  

for proper decoding and execution.
