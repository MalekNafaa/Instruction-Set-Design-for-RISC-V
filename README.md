This project focuses on designing a custom instruction set architecture (ISA) for a RISC-V CPU, incorporating essential components such as the Program Counter (PC),
Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Register File, Control Unit, and Memory Units.
The custom instruction set design includes a range of operations, including arithmetic, logical, load/store, and branch instructions. The goal is to document the design,
explain the control signals and data flow, and provide a sample program to demonstrate the functionality of the custom RISC-V CPU.
